## Project Overview
This project consists of a web page that allows users to flip a coin and see if it lands on heads or tails. The results of each flip are displayed on the screen, and users can also reset the counts to start over. The game uses HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.

## File Structure
The project is organized into three main files:

- `index.html`: The HTML file that structures the web page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the web page.
- `index.js`: The JavaScript file that adds functionality to the web page.

## How It Works
### HTML (index.html)
The HTML file sets up the basic structure of the web page. It includes:
- A container for displaying the counts of heads and tails.
- An area for the coin which shows heads or tails based on the flip result.
- Buttons for flipping the coin and resetting the counts.

### CSS (style.css)
The CSS file provides the styling for the game, including:
- Basic styles for layout and typography.
- Styles for the container, coin, and buttons.
- Animations for flipping the coin.

### JavaScript (index.js)
The JavaScript file contains the logic for the game, including:
- Event listeners for the flip and reset buttons.
- Functions to update the displayed counts.
- Functions to manage the coin flip animation and disable the button during the animation.

## How to Run the Project
1. **Download the project files**: Ensure you have the `index.html`, `style.css`, and `index.js` files in the same directory.
2. **Open `index.html` in a web browser**: You can do this by double-clicking the file or opening it through your browser's "Open File" dialog.
3. **Interact with the game**: 
    - Use the "Flip Coin" button to flip the coin and see the results.
    - Use the "Reset" button to reset the counts of heads and tails.
